## The Practical aspects of Amogh's Super Stock App

In the current day, where job loss seems to be a certainty for many people, rather than just a hypothetical situation;
many people are looking for alternative forms of making ends meet. And this is where the stock market comes into play.
With the situation caused by *COVID-19*, the markets are very disattached from the actual dire situation of the everyday
economy. Stock trading has been up by an astounding **267%** year-over-year growth from the same time last year 
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KN5AqXmYn5E). As said earlier, this is caused by a few reasons:
- Record amount of joblosses seen due to the collapse of the retail sector.
- The prevalence of commission free trading platforms mostly aimed at millennials (Robinhood, Acorns)
- The volatilty of the stock market, allowing for rapid growths or devastating losses
- Or, in some cases, as a method of spending quarantine time doing something "productive" (the case for me)   

## The personal aspect

While this may seem like an embellished scenario, this app is something I intend to continue using and updating. Stock
trading tips has been something that my father, and I relinquish together. Watching the stocks soar, in the more likely 
scenario, tumble, is a collective experience that my father, and I relinquish in together, in all of this sadness or 
glory. We have been having trouble tracking all the investments and their statistics. One of the aspects I intend to
integrate into this app once the course has finished are API calls to track the stocks prices and their profits/losses.
